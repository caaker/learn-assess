    CHECKLIST AND NOETS FOR HACKER RANK

    - Remember to set spacing to 2
    - Remember to use shorter names to keep typing to a minimal
    - Remember to use a while or for loop for flexibility
    - Remember to work the problem out on paper first if needed
    - Remember to check the debug output before reading the question
    - Remember to determine if the input is the actual input to your method or if you need to add arguments
    - Sometimes the questions inputs do not actually match the inputs given ( name problem )
    - Edge cases appear to be false ( findMedian )
    - Sometimes, it appears brute force ( too slow ) will cause test cases to fail ( not actually edge cases )
